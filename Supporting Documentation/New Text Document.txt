Initial checks
The customer controller tests work fine, but the customer DAO doesn't. Not finding column, checked names and seems fine, suspect not connecting to DB properly.

Fix
Mix of misname and undropped tables. Should be in temp table, but running tests off of primary table apparently, causing issue. Now resolved with pre-test drop table.

Initial Checks
Googled, seems to suggest jav is not correct version? Will ask Pawel for guidance.
