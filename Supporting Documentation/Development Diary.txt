Development Diary begun 10/05/2022 in response to design decision that had not been obvious.

Encountered possibility I hadn't previously considered. Is it better to update CRUDController and use in Orders for "delete item within order" as opposed to pre-existing "delete order" or just create new methods within the appropriate order classes.

Also encountered issue with orders, attempting to incorporate orderitems into my java. Wrote code that does not meet spec at the moment, as placeholder and to test later logic works correctly. Will update within spec before finishing, obviously.

Further to issue above, currently using separate methods for adding and removing item after order creation, but may well change.

Distracted by QA contract coming through - took time to read that, which delayed development by an hour.

Realised that initial UML hadn't been stored in UML folder, so hadn't been uploaded with other information.

Massive change to order and item_order logic, had orders referencing order items not the other way round. Pawel illustrated order-items many to many relationship, as I had misunderstood database logic  Small change to order code required.
